# odin-draw
## About
A basic 'etch-a-sketch' style drawing tool made for The Odin project, with html, css, and javascript.

## Limitations
I've decided to keep this simple, in the spirit of the actual toy. The canvas will always react to any cursor movement.

## To-Do
At some point I would like to expand on the 'change resolution' button so that it doesn't clear the canvas, but instead scales up or down.
